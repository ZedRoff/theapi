<h1>The API</h1>
<p style="color: red;">This app is deprecated since the 2 npm modules that I used are now not working at all</p>

<p>A simple API built in NodeJS (back end), and vanilla html/css as (front end).</p>

<br />
<h2>What does the API do ?</h2>
<p>It simply scrape the OP.GG api, and soon other APIs to give you gaming statistics before playing an LoL game. It also has a website, to show you how you can use it.</p>
<br />
<h2>What did I learned ?</h2>
<p>I learned making routes, an API, and intuitive design, with divided screen, but also manipulating more vanilla JavaScript.</p>
